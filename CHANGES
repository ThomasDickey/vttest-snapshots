-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

980328
	add logic to ensure we pick up the proper choice (e.g., in Norwegian)
	where the choice depends on the terminal id (e.g., vt220 vs vt320).

	minor correction for vt220 vs vt320 logic in do_scs for Latin-1 vs
	British character set.

980327
	implement test for single-shift (SS2 and SS3).

980326
	implement shift-in/shift-out character-set tests oriented toward VT220.

	several corrections to VT220 character-set tests, from reports by
	Kenneth R. Robinette <zkrr01@mailbox.neosoft.com>:

		+ move SCS strings to immediately before/after the tests to
		  avoid conflict with menu selection, and to keep the tests
		  distinct.

		+ use 96-character control sequences only for character sets
		  (Latin 1), and 94-character control sequences for the
		  National Replacement character sets.

		+ add ISO Latin-1 as a font option

		+ add Swiss as a font option

980310
	decode known values for secondary DA response.

	make mouse-highlight test a little clearer by putting '+' marks at the
	corners of the highlight-region.

970524
	eliminate 'gets()' calls, which can overflow buffer.

970520
	implement CF_FCNTL_VS_IOCTL check to make this build on SCO 3.x and
	CLIX, which are both non-POSIX systems.

970518
	add CF_POSIX_VDISABLE test to work around gcc 2.6.2 bug.

970419
	correct sign-extension in xterm mouse-position

961215
	correct err introduced between d960905 and v2_5 that broke test for IRM
	mode by using decsclm (reported by Jeffrey Altman).

961125
	add VT220 character-set tests for locking-shifts

VERSION 2.7

961113
	corrected early return from test for DECRPM when badly-formatted
	reply is received.

	add DA1 codes from vt500 manual (from Jeffrey Altman).

	refined test to restore ANSI mode based on VT420 testing.

961029
	extend vt52 test to check operating level when restoring ANSI mode.

961028
	implemented tests for VT220/VT420 function keys, editing keypad.

961027
	change suggested by Jeffrey Altman:  set the terminal's default
	operating level to the maximum rather than VT100 (this is slightly
	incompatible with VTTEST 1.7).

960930
	amended reset_colors() to do SGR 0 at the end.

960928
	allow 8-bit input for keyboard (function keys, cursor keys) tests.

	correct I/O modes on timeout

	added padding, corrected some states on return from vt52 tests.

	increase buffer size for DECTSR.

960927
	modified scan_chr (used in DECCIR test) to properly diagnose Pericom's
	3.2 emulator.

	check in setup-menu for VT52.

	modify inputline to retain whitespace

	modify 'reset_colors()' to accommodate grossly-nonstandard emulators
	that don't reset colors with SGR 0.

	added test for SGR 0

960921
	implement REP test

	corrected highlighting refresh in function-key test

	use raw-mode for VT52 DECID test.

VERSION 2.6

960911
	corrected DECBI, DECFI (documentation from Jeffrey Altman), SRM (on
	VT420) tests.

960908
	implement DECDLD tests. Tested with fonts from "The VT200 TOOLKIT" by
	Tabik & DiGiantomasso, Professional Software (available via DECUS).

960905
	implement DECCARA, DECRARA, DECSACE, DECSERA tests.

960901
	implement DECBKM, DECCRA, DECERA, DECFRA, DECKBUM, DECKPM, DECNKM,
	SRM tests

960830
	implement 2nd, 3rd DA, DECFI, DECBI, DECSNLS, DECRQTSR tests.

960828
	provide analysis of DECCIR

	implement tests for DECSASD, DECSSDT

960825
	corrected error (I) introduced in tst_movements (main.c 1.6) that broke
	test of cursor-control characters inside ESC sequences (reported by
	Albert D. Cahalan).

	implement DECDC, DECIC tests.

960825
	added -l (logging) option.

	added -p (padding) option.

	port to VAX/VMS, for testing VT420

960821
	Corrected test for DECUDK, omitted lock-parameter caused keys to be
	locked, so that only the first key definition was used (reported by
	Jeffrey Altman).

	Corrected test for DECRPM, missing '?' (reported by Jeffrey Altman
	<jaltman@watsun.cc.columbia.edu>).

VERSION 2.5

960818
	implements most VT420 report-tests.

	make menu-skeleton for VT420 tests (some are needed for xterm tests),
	marking the non-implemented entries with an '*'.

960817
	add tests/examples for xterm mouse controls

960816
	remove obsolete support for Sargasso C (TOPS-20)

960813
	use usleep() if the system has it, to make responses faster.

	add menu-entry for toggling 7/8-bit input/output controls

	split-out keyboard.c, organized by a set of submenus.

	split-out reports.c, parameterized to allow testing 8-bit controls.
	make submenu for individual reports.

	modified menu decoding to accept '*' to step through all submenus.

VERSION 2.4

960807
	Implement test for VT5xx C7C1T and S8C1T

	Remove check for scrolling-behavior in CPL and CNL (no one but kermit
	seems to consider doing this).

	Modified tst_reports() to use raw mode (the original sgtty logic
	doesn't do this) so that termios works.  Modified termios settings for
	crmod so it doesn't touch INLCR and IGNCR, and for raw mode to leave
	c_oflag alone - this works on Linux.

	corrected some typos in DECSCA test.

960806
	Testing by Albert D. Cahalan <acahalan@cs.uml.edu> with VT510,
	suggested initializing with the 80/132 mode enabled.  Says real
	terminals need padding...

960804
	Implement tests for: SL, SD, SU, SR

	Modified "Test of screen features with ISO 6429 SGR 22-27 codes"
	to test concealed text.

VERSION 2.3

960803
	Implement tests for the following ISO 6429 controls:  CBT, CHA, CHT,
	CNL, CPL, ECH, HPA, SL, SPA, SR, VPA.

	Implement tests for DEC VT220 controls:  DECSCA, DECTCEM

960802
	Restructure non-VT100 menus, making them separate from the base VT100
	tests.

VERSION 2.2

960721
	Initialize terminal with 80/132 switching enabled

	Casper Dik <casper@holland.Sun.COM> explained why tests fail on Solaris
	2.5 (can workaround with lots of fflush calls ;-)

960716
	Add tests for CDE-compatible xterm

VERSION 2.1

960708
	Change background color to blue for tests (some yellows and greens
	are too close together).

960702
	Added extended graphic-rendition tests (ISO 6429)

VERSION 2.0

960624
	Added color/graphic-rendition, and color-scrolling tests.

960623
	Implemented color tests (test-pattern, bce-test, insert/delete lines)

960621
	Implemented auto-config for termios (tested on SunOS 4.1.1, IRIX 5.2,
	Solaris 5.4).

960618
	Modified to support nonstandard screen geometry.  For example, you can
	test Linux console (which has 25 lines) by typing 'vttest 25'.

	Implemented auto-config for termio (tested on SunOS 4.1.1).

960617
	Corrected broken write-to-string-constant in tst_keyboard().

	Split-out logic for ttymodes.c

	Converted to ANSI C (it's a lot easier to avoid breaking code when all
	of the interfaces are fully specified).

	Split-out sargasso.h from header.h, to avoid nested-comment syntax.  (I
	don't think anyone will be using that again, anyway).

	from original version (I've found nothing more recent ;-), marked 1.7b
	1985-04-19, begin making changes to support testing for ANSI color
	features.
