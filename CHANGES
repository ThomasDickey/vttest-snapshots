-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 2.4

960807
	Implement test for VT5xx C7C1T and C8C1T

	Remove check for scrolling-behavior in CPL and CNL (no one but kermit
	seems to consider doing this).

	Modified tst_reports() to use raw mode (the original sgtty logic
	doesn't do this) so that termios works.  Modified termios settings for
	crmod so it doesn't touch INLCR and IGNCR, and for raw mode to leave
	c_oflag alone - this works on Linux.

	corrected some typos in DECSCA test.

960804
	Implement tests for: SL, SD, SU, SR

	Modified "Test of screen features with ISO 6429 SGR 22-27 codes"
	to test concealed text.

VERSION 2.3

960803
	Implement tests for the following ISO 6429 controls:  CBT, CHA, CHT,
	CNL, CPL, ECH, HPA, SL, SPA, SR, VPA.

	Implement tests for DEC VT220 controls:  DECSCA, DECTCEM

960802
	Restructure non-VT100 menus, making them separate from the base VT100
	tests.

VERSION 2.2

960721
	Initialize terminal with 80/132 switching enabled

960716
	Add tests for CDE-compatible xterm

VERSION 2.1

960708
	Change background color to blue for tests (some yellows and greens
	are too close together).

960702
	Added extended graphic-rendition tests (ISO 6429)

VERSION 2.0

960624
	Added color/graphic-rendition, and color-scrolling tests.

960623
	Implemented color tests (test-pattern, bce-test, insert/delete lines)

960621
	Implemented auto-config for termios (tested on SunOS 4.1.1, IRIX 5.2,
	Solaris 5.4).

960618
	Modified to support nonstandard screen geometry.  For example, you can
	test Linux console (which has 25 lines) by typing 'vttest 25'.

	Implemented auto-config for termio (tested on SunOS 4.1.1).

960617
	Corrected broken write-to-string-constant in tst_keyboard().

	Split-out logic for ttymodes.c

	Converted to ANSI C (it's a lot easier to avoid breaking code when all
	of the interfaces are fully specified).

	Split-out sargasso.h from header.h, to avoid nested-comment syntax.  (I
	don't think anyone will be using that again, anyway).

	from original version (I've found nothing more recent ;-), marked 1.7b
	1985-04-19, begin making changes to support testing for ANSI color
	features.
