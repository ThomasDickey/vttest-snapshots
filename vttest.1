.SH NAME
vttest \- test VT100-type terminal
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vttest \fI[options] [24x80.132]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vttest
is a program designed to test the functionality of a VT100 terminal
(or emulator thereof).
It tests both display (escape sequence handling) and keyboard.
.PP
The program is menu-driven and contains full on-line operating instructions.
.TP 3
-
To run a given menu-item, you must enter its number.
.TP 3
-
Menu items start at zero; this is the "Exit" item in almost all cases.
.TP 3
-
You can run all menu-items (for a given level) by entering an asterisk,
i.e, `*'.
.TP 3
-
You can force a repaint of the menu items by entering "?".
.TP 3
-
A few menus can be more than one page.  Use "n" and "p" to
switch to the next or previous page.
.SH OPTIONS
You can specify the screen geometry in the form \fI[24x80.132]\fP,
i.e., 24 lines, 80 minimum columns, 132 maximum columns.
If your terminal does not switch between 80 and 132 columns you
may specify 24x80.80, for example, to avoid a misleading display.
.PP
Other options are:
.TP 5
.BI -f " file"
specify a file containing a DRCS (soft character definition) string.
.TP 5
.B -l
log test results to \fIvttest.log\fP.
.TP 5
.B -p
use padding, e.g., for a VT100 connected to a high-speed line.
.TP 5
.B -s
add time-delay in selected panning/scrolling options to show details.
.TP 5
.B -8
use 8-bit controls (this can be changed with a menu option).
