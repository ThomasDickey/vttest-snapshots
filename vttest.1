.SH NAME
vttest \- test VT100-type terminal
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vttest \fI[options] [24x80.132]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vttest
is a program designed to test the functionality of a VT100 terminal
(or emulator thereof).
It tests both display (escape sequence handling) and keyboard.
.PP
The program is menu-driven and contains full on-line operating instructions.
.bP
To run a given menu-item, you must enter its number.
.bP
Menu items start at zero; this is the \*(``Exit\*('' item in almost all cases.
.bP
You can run all menu-items (for a given level) by entering an asterisk,
i.e, \*(``*'.
.bP
You can force a repaint of the menu items by entering \*(``?\*(''.
.bP
A few menus can be more than one page.
Use \*(``n\*('' and \*(``p\*('' to switch to the next or previous page.
.SH OPTIONS
You can specify the screen geometry in the form \fI[24x80.132]\fP,
i.e.,
.bP
24 lines,
.bP
80 minimum columns, and
.bP
132 maximum columns.
.PP
If your terminal does not switch between 80 and 132 columns you
may specify 24x80.80, for example, to avoid a misleading display.
.PP
Other options are:
.TP 5
.B \-V
print the program version, and exit.
.TP 5
.BI \-f " fontfile"
specify a file containing a DRCS (soft character definition) string.
.TP 5
.B \-l
log test results to \fIvttest.log\fP.
.TP 5
.B \-p
use padding, e.g., for a VT100 connected to a high-speed line.
.TP 5
.B \-q
show only the most recent part of a continuous response,
e.g., any-event mouse tests, to improve readability of the test.
.TP 5
.B \-s
add time-delay in selected panning/scrolling options to show details.
.TP 5
.B \-8
use 8-bit controls (this can be changed with a menu option).
