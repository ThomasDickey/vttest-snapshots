.SH NAME
vttest \- test VT100-type terminal
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vttest \fI[options] [24x80.132]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vttest
is a program designed to test the functionality of a VT100 terminal
(or emulator thereof).
It tests both display (escape sequence handling) and keyboard.
.PP
The program is menu-driven and contains full on-line operating instructions.
To run a given menu-item, you must enter its number.
You can run all menu-items (for a given level) by entering an asterisk,
i.e, `*'.
.
.SH OPTIONS
You can specify the screen geometry in the form \fI[24x80.132]\fP,
i.e., 24 lines, 80 minimum columns, 132 maximum columns.
If your terminal does not switch between 80 and 132 columns you
may specify 24x80.80, for example, to avoid a misleading display.
.PP
Other options are:
.TP 5
.BI -f " file"
specify a file containing a DRCS (soft character definition) string.
.TP 5
.B -l
log test results to \fIvttest.log\fP.
.TP 5
.B -p
use padding, e.g., for a VT100 connected to a high-speed line.
.TP 5
.B -8
use 8-bit controls (this can be changed with a menu option).
