Please report bugs to dickey@clark.net

This is a list of known problems with VTTEST:

  + tests for DECFI and DECBI don't seem to function on VT420 (I need better
    documentation)

  + SD and SU tests pass with dtterm, but not with VT420.

  + the skip_csi/skip_dcs functions are too permissive (they're allowing
    either 8-bit or 7-bit responses).

  + the keyboard test should allow 8-bit responses

  + when I test the DECRQSS responses on a VT420, they usually come back
    with a code '1' (according to my manual, that's invalid), though the
    data looks correct otherwise.
